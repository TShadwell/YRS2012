A Nice Day Out
===============
At some point we all need a nice day out.
This is a web application to facilitate that need through government data.

Planned features:
* Weather awareness
* Routing
* Pricing
* Nearby Restaraunts (that quality of hygene API?)
* The main dataset, the DEFRA linked data on bathing waters.
* Climate data would be useful for making a beach score/type.
